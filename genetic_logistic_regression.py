'''
In this code, we define the genetic algorithm that optimizes the weights of the logistic regression model. The genetic algorithm starts by initializing a population of individuals (i.e., weight vectors) with random values. It then calculates the fitness of each individual in the population (i.e., the loss of the logistic regression model with the corresponding weights) and selects the best individuals based on their fitness. The selected individuals are then combined to create new offspring using crossover, and the new offspring are mutated with a certain probability. This process is repeated for the specified number of generations, and the best individual from the final population is returned as the result of the genetic algorithm.
